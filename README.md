# ETHernals Hackathon project âœŒ
This project is developed in the ETHernals 2022 ETHIndia Hackathon.<br>

## Project Description
Users can come on the Super app and can post their doubts which they want to be answered by the community. Anyone can approach the question and post their answers.<br>
Other peers form the community can come and either post their own answers to a doubt or upvote a posted answer.

## Aim
This helps to understand the level of contribution experience a person might have and is worthy in the eyes of the developer commuinty for a reward. The Doubt poster has an option to attach a reward amount with the doubt, and if the worthy person comes the contract will start a stream of rewards to that person's wallet!

This provides a challenging environment and a lot of room for development of each answer quality. As if someone else achieves higher number of upvotes, the stream of rewards will be redirected to the new worthy person.

## Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
